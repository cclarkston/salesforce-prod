Hello {!Lead.FirstName},<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for completing the dental health survey sponsored by ClearChoice Dental Implant Centers.  <br/>
<br/>
Moderate to severe dental issues are not uncommon among U.S. adults. In fact, by the age of 50, the average American is missing 4 or more teeth. Beyond appearances and discomfort, missing or failing teeth prevent many people from living the active, healthy life theyâ€™ve earned. <br/>
<br/>
In this era of advanced 21st Century dentistry, no one should suffer from chronic dental problems. There are permanent, convenient and affordable solutions to most issues. Let our doctors show you the possibilities! <br/>
<br/>
To get started, simply reply to this email with your phone contact information or call us today at 1-888-654-4675 to schedule a <b>Free, No-Risk Consultation with a complimentary 3D CAT scan (a $700 value). 
</b>
<br/>
<br/>
A lifetime of freedom from your dental problems is closer than you think. We look forward to meeting you.
<br/>
<br/>

Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
