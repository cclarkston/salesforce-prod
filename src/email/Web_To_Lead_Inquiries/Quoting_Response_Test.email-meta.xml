    <textOnly>Hello {!Lead.FirstName},

Thank you for contacting ClearChoice Dental Implant Centers, America’s #1 choice for dental implants.

We hope to have an opportunity to serve you and understand you have a question about pricing. Because every dental condition is different, this is a question that’s impossible to specifically answer without a doctor’s consult.

Costs follow proper treatment plans, which are influenced by:

•	How many teeth are loose or missing?

•	What area of the mouth are these missing or failing teeth located?

•	What is the condition of the bone?

•	What is the condition of the soft tissue?

•	What is the condition of the remaining teeth?

It is for these reasons that only the doctor can put fees in writing, and only after studying your complimentary x-ray and preparing a definitive treatment plan.

Please call me today at 1-888-654-4675, and I’ll set you up for a Free, No-Risk Consultation and 3D CAT scan (a $700 value).

Sincerely,

{!Lead.Call_Center_Agent__c}
