Hello {!Lead.FirstName},<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for contacting ClearChoice Dental Implant Centers, America’s #1 choice for dental implants.   <br/>
<br/>
We hope to have an opportunity to serve you and understand you have a question about pricing. Because every dental condition is different, this is a question that’s impossible to specifically answer without a doctor’s consult. <br/>
<br/>
Costs follow proper treatment plans, which are influenced by:  <br/>
<br/>
<ul>
•	How many teeth are loose or missing?</ul>
 <ul>

•	What area of the mouth are these missing or failing teeth located? </ul>

 <ul>

•	What is the condition of the bone?</ul>

 <ul>

•	What is the condition of the soft tissue?</ul>

 <ul>

•	What is the condition of the remaining teeth? </ul>

It is for these reasons that only <i>the doctor can put fees in writing,</i> and only after studying your complimentary x-ray and preparing a definitive treatment plan.  
<br/>
<br/>

Please call me today at 1-888-654-4675, and I’ll set you up for a <b>Free, No-Risk Consultation and 3D CAT scan (a $700 value). </b>
<br/>
<br/>

Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
