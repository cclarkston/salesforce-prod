    <subject>Request for Quote on Dental Implant Fees</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Lead.FirstName} {!Lead.LastName},

We have several people with this exact question.  There are various conditions that can affect the fee.  Some detailed questions need to be asked and answered:

·         How many teeth are missing/loose?
·         What area of the mouth are they missing/loose in?
·         What is the condition of the bone?
·         What is the condition of the soft tissue?
·         What is the condition of the remaining teeth? 
·         What teeth, if any, do you want to save?
·         What type of dental appliance do you have?  A partial denture, full denture, fixed bridge?

I will be happy to verbally give you some ranges over the phone.  Unfortunately, only the doctor can put fees in writing after studying your x-ray and doing a definitive treatment plan.  

Please call me today at 1-888-654-4675 and I can help to give you a ballpark of cost or I’ll set you up for a free consultation and panoramic x-ray.  

Sincerely,
{!Lead.OwnerFullName}
