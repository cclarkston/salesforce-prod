Hello _______,

Reviewing your record recently, we realized that the dental implant treatment plan we diagnosed for you has not been completed. We are concerned about what this could ultimately mean for you and your long-term dental health. Our goal is to help you restore your oral health and smile for a lifetime. 

Many patients don't realize that delays in treatment can often mean the difference between a favorable prognosis and a guarded one, often resulting in increased cost and discomfort. Additionally, advances in modern implant dentistry make implants more predictable, reliable and comfortable than ever before. Many of our patients also take advantage of our comfortable monthly payment plans to assist them in creating the smile they've always wanted right now. 

We respect that the decision is ultimately yours. If you have decided against treatment, or if you have decided to have treatment performed in another office, please call to tell us. You won't offend us by either decision and we will update our records accordingly. 

If you have decided to have your treatment completed in our office, let this letter serve as the motivation to call and make that first treatment appointment. We'll have you smiling in no time and you'll be glad you did! We look forward to seeing you very soon.
