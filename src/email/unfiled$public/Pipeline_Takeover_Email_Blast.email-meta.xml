    <subject>Your New Partner at ClearChoice Sacramento</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello,

I want to introduce myself as your new ClearChoice consultant. As of June 1, 2018  your previous consultant, Rachel Hoffman, has moved to a new location in Southern California.

It&apos;s exciting that you have taken the first steps to address your current dental condition and your future hopes that we can achieve! I would love the opportunity to meet with you during a second consult to learn about where your dental needs stand today and how we might be able to come up with a plan to get you started in treatment. I look forward to getting to know you and learning how I can best help you accomplish your dental hopes.

Please feel free to respond to this email or call me directly at the numbers listed below, so we can set up a time to meet.

Regards,
Kristina Griffin
ClearChoice Sacramento
Patient Education Consultant
