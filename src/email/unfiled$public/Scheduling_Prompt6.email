Hello _________,

During your last appointment, we recommended a treatment plan for your dental care. However, we did not set a date for your next appointment. 

Your dental health is our number one priority, and delaying dental care may result in more extensive treatment and additional costs. We encourage you to make arrangements to start the treatment soon. 

We are dedicated to giving you the healthy, beautiful smile you deserve. Please give us a call to schedule an appointment to start your treatment. We are happy to answer all of your questions about the treatment and the health care financing payment options we offer. 

We look forward to seeing you again soonâ€‹.
